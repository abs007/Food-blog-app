# Classic Spaghetti Carbonara

A creamy, rich pasta dish that's actually much easier to make than you might think. The key is to work quickly and use quality ingredients.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound (450g) spaghetti
- 4 ounces (115g) pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup (100g) freshly grated Pecorino Romano
- 1 cup (100g) freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente.

2. While the pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add pancetta and cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes. If using garlic, add it in the last minute of cooking.

3. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, grated cheeses, and plenty of black pepper until well combined.

4. When pasta is done, reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain.

5. Working quickly, add the hot pasta to the skillet with pancetta, tossing to combine.

6. Remove from heat and pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly to coat the pasta and create a creamy sauce. If needed, add a splash of reserved pasta water to achieve desired consistency.

7. Serve immediately with extra grated cheese and black pepper.

## Tips

- Use room temperature eggs to help create a smoother sauce
- Never add the egg mixture while the pan is on the heat, or you'll end up with scrambled eggs
- The sauce will continue to thicken as it sits, so serve immediately

Enjoy your homemade carbonara!
